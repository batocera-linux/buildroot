Subject: [PATCH] Fix memory leak parsing group addresses without a display
 name.

When there was a group address terminator with no previous
addresses (including the group display-name), an address would be
allocated but not attached to the address list.

Change this to only allocate when last exists.

It would be more correct to not allocate at all unless we are inside a
group list, but I will address that in a separate commit to master.
